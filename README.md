### Spam Mail Detector
Welcome to the Spam Mail Detector repository! This project aims to detect spam emails by analyzing their 
subject lines and content. It includes functions to parse email files, preprocess text data, and apply checks for spam indicators.

# Features
- **Email Parsing**: Extracts email headers and body content from email files.
